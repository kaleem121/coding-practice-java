## 🚀 Daily Progress

### ✅ [Day 1: Loops & Basics](notes/day1.md)
- [MultiplicationTable.java](day1/MultiplicationTable.java) → Print multiplication table of a number up to a given limit.  
- [ReverseNumber.java](day1/ReverseNumber.java) → Reverse the digits of an integer (handles negative numbers).  

### ⏳ [Day 2: Strings & Recursion](notes/day2.md)
- [PalindromeString.java](day2/PalindromeString.java)  
- [FactorialNumber.java](day2/FactorialNumber.java)

## 🎯 Roadmap (30 Days Plan)
- **Week 1:** Basics (loops, arrays, strings).  
- **Week 2:** Arrays + Strings + HashMap (search, sort, anagrams, frequency).  
- **Week 3:** Core Data Structures (stack, queue, linked list, recursion).  
- **Week 4:** Pattern-based problems (two pointers, sliding window, binary search).  
- **Week 5:** Mock tests + Revision.

## ✅ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaleem121/coding-practice-java.git
2. Open in Eclipse/IntelliJ.

3. Run any file with main method and give inputs as required.

## 📝 Notes

For each problem, I maintain separate notes with:

Problem statement (in my words).

Pseudocode / approach.

Final clean code snippet.

Time/Space complexity.

Key learnings.

👉 Full Java code = kept in this repo.
👉 Concise notes = kept in notes/ folder (for revision).

## 🏆 Goals

Solve 2 problems per day.

Push code daily.

Solve at least 50+ problems in 30 days.

Gain confidence for coding tests & interviews.
